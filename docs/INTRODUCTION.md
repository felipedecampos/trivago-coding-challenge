My name is **Felipe de Campos**, and I have been working as a programmer for **7 years**.

When I first started coding, I learned a lot of things **on my own** and I carry this with me up until now. I'm constantly **looking for improving my skills** and therefore I like to learn new languages or methodologies.

What drives me to work at Trivago, is that **I like the possibilty of being creative when it comes to coding**. Not to mention that **working in a different country** would be a unique experience.
