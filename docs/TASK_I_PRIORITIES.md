### Urgent

**1\. Clicking on "View Deal" you get redirected to a wrong OTA item landing page**
 
Trivago's purpose is to connect travelers and hotels, so when we redirect the users to a wrong landing page, it means Trivago is not delivering its proposed services.

**4\. Price filter returns incorrect results**

Price filter is the first option users can set, so I assume it`s the most used by them to find their hotels. Therefore, this bug has a huge impact on most Trivago`s users.

### High

**2\. Pagination on search results page doesn't work**

It`s important that users have access to all options in their search, but with this bug a user would be able to see the first page of results correctly. That`s why I classified it as High instead of Urgent.

**5\. Sorting by distance to city center doesn't work**

This is a standard filter the users can use to find their hotels, it means it is often used by them, so this is to be prioritized with a high category.

### Normal

**3\. Country flag for US is wrong**

This bug is affecting only in a visual concept, the text is probably right, however it may confuse users when selecting their country and impact a great number of users who live in US.

### Low

**6\. Results take too long to load when searching for a 5 star hotel with spa in
Belarus**

This filter is restricted to a few number of users, besides results display correctly, they just take longer to show.
